                    Jacob Ryles, or Jake for short, is a professional chef who works at the local retirement facility. He has been in that role for a few years and has a real passion for cooking. He gets a great sense of enjoyment out of people enjoying his food. He has some hobbies, namely working on cars, cooking, and just being in the outdoors. He was even involved in an outdoor rally a few years ago with an old Mercedes that he fixed up. Along with his enjoyment of cars, he also enjoys car related movie series like the Fast and Furious movie series. He also enjoys traveling abroad with his wife when he is able to do so. However, as he says, “going to other countries can get pretty expensive pretty fast.”
                    Jake went to college in Ithaca, New York, and has a 4-year bachelor’s degree in marketing communications. However, despite his degree, he much prefers to live a more down-to-earth lifestyle working as a chef. He has expressed that he feels his 4-year degree was expensive and didn’t align with his desires and passions in life. He isn’t a big risk taker, but he does like to do things himself. He told me a story about how he injured his hand while trying to repair his dishwasher, along with some interesting stories of improvisation after part of his rally went wrong a few years ago.
                    Jacob is a relatively quiet, but smart individual. He likes to exercise, spend time outside, and socialize with his friends and neighbors when he is able to do so. However, like most of us he also enjoys some quiet time for himself when he feels like it’s needed. He has a very interesting history, a background of higher education, and is a generally pleasant character.
